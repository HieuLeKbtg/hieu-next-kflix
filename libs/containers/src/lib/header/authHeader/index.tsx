                        Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck
                        seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City.
                        Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day
                        job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile
                        attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him.
